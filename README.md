# Classic Arcade Game Clone

###### Project Overview

Project #3 of Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). 
The task was to recreate the [classic arcade game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxeHV1kt7iU&feature=youtu.be) with provided visual assets and a game loop engine by adding a number of entities to the game including, enemies and collectable items.

###### Project Goal
The game functions correctly and runs error free:

* Player can not move off screen
* Enemy cross the screen
* Enemy-vs-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)
* Enemy-vs-player collision resets the game
* Something happens when player wins
