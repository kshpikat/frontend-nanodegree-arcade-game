# Classic Arcade Game Clone

###### Project Overview

Project #3 of Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). 
The task was to recreate the [classic arcade game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxeHV1kt7iU&feature=youtu.be) with provided visual assets and a game loop engine by adding a number of entities to the game including, enemies and collectable items.

###### Project Goal
The game functions correctly and runs error free:

* Player can not move off screen
* Enemy cross the screen
* Enemy-vs-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)
* Enemy-vs-player collision resets the game
* Something happens when player wins

## How to play

1. Use the arrow keys to move the player.
2. Get to the top to get to the next level.
3. Collect as many gems as possible to rise your score.
4. Please avoid bugs to stay alive (if you can).
5. You have only 3 lives to win the game.
6. Sorry, there is actually no way to win the game, but still keep trying :)
